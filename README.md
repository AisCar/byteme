Media Forum - Group Project


This is a second year Computer Science group project. We created a web page that works as a media forum. Users can log in and comment on movies and tv shows.
Users will be able to search our movie and tv shows database as well. Users have their own profile pages.

The project is written in MetorJS, using MongoDB.
